1.	**Trend Analysis**

The trend analysis chart indicates a prolonged downtrend in crude oil prices over the past 23 years, particularly since 2016. Both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages validate this decline, with the short-term average below the long-term one, signaling a short-term bearish trend.

Several factors contribute to this decline:

•	Increased oil supply from the United States, a significant producer.

•	Slowing global economic growth reducing oil demand.
Consequences:

•	Consumers may benefit from lower fuel prices.

•	Businesses relying on oil as a raw material could see cost advantages.

•	Oil-exporting nations may face challenges due to reduced export revenues.
In summary, the chart suggests a continuing decline in crude oil prices, with potential global economic implications.


 
2. **Violation Analysis**
  
The violation analysis chart tracks the daily volatility of crude oil prices across 24 years, measured by the standard deviation of daily price fluctuations. Rising volatility implies greater price unpredictability.

Causes of increased volatility:

•	Globalization of the oil market complicates supply and demand forecasting.

•	Amplifying effects from financial derivatives usage in oil trading.

•	Political instability in oil-producing nations leading to supply disruptions.
Heightened volatility poses challenges for businesses, investors, and consumers, making future planning difficult and potentially raising consumer costs.
The chart highlights extreme volatility during significant events like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by factors such as supply disruptions, economic shifts, and market speculation.

While a valuable tool for understanding crude oil volatility, remember:

•	Crude oil volatility fluctuates with various influences.

•	The chart is retrospective, not predictive.

•	Future volatility predictions should consider supply and demand dynamics.
Ultimately, it aids risk management and informed decision-making.


 
3.	**Seasonality Pattern** 
  
The seasonality pattern of crude oil prices is not always consistent, and it can be affected by a number of factors, such as political events or natural disasters. However, it is a useful tool for understanding the historical price movements of crude oil and for making predictions about future prices.

•	The chart you sent shows the seasonality pattern of crude oil prices in the United States from January 2022 to September 2023. 
    
    o	The average price of crude oil was highest in April (110 USD) 
    
    o	In May (112 USD),
    
    o	Lowest in January (100 USD) 
    
    o	In September (108 USD)
 
 This pattern is consistent with the general seasonality pattern of crude oil prices.

•	It is important to note that the seasonality pattern of crude oil prices is not always perfect. There are often periods when the price of oil deviates from the pattern. For example, the price of oil was relatively high in the summer of 2022, even though it is typically lower during that time of year. This was due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic.


 
4.	**Correlation Analysis (between Crude Oil and S&F 500)**
  
The correlation plot shows the correlation between the price of crude oil (CL=F) and the S&P 500 index. The correlation coefficient is -0.25, which indicates a weak negative correlation. This means that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions.

A negative correlation means that when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. In this case, when the price of crude oil increases, the S&P 500 index tends to decrease. This is because crude oil is a commodity, and its price is affected by supply and demand. When the price of crude oil increases, it becomes more expensive to produce goods and services, which can lead to lower profits for businesses. This can cause the stock market to decline.



 
5.	**Event Analysis**
The chart sent shows the price of crude oil with Russian Ukraine War from January 2022 to September 2023. The events marked on the chart are:

  	o	24 February 2022: Russian invasion of Ukraine

  	o	28 August 2022: Southeastern front

  	o	11 November 2022: 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives

  	o	12 November 2022: Second stalemate

   o	8 June 2023: 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive

•	The chart shows that the price of crude oil increased sharply after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. This is because the invasion raised concerns about a disruption to global oil supplies. 

•	The price of crude oil peaked at around $140 per barrel in March 2022, but it has since declined to around $100 per barrel.

•	However, the Second stalemate event on 12 November 2022 and the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive event on 8 June 2023 could lead to lower oil prices, as they could signal a resolution to the conflict.


 
6.	**Forecasting**
The chart shows that the forecasted price of crude oil is expected to increase gradually over the next two years. The price is expected to reach around $125 per barrel in 2025.
Here are some inferences and observations that can be drawn from the forecasting price chart:

•	The price is expected to reach around $125 per barrel in 2025.

•	The historical data shows that the price of crude oil has been increasing over the past few years.

•	The forecasted data suggests that the price of crude oil will continue to increase over the next two years.



7.	**ADF Test** 
Analysis of ADF Test:

ADF Statistic: -2.70
This statistic checks for time series stationarity. If it's less than critical values, the series is stationary. Here, it's greater, indicating non-stationarity.

p-value: 0.0745
p-value assesses ADF statistic's significance. If < 0.05, you can reject the non-stationary hypothesis. Here, p-value > 0.05, failing to reject it, confirming non-stationarity.

Critical Values:
1%: -3.43
5%: -2.86
10%: -2.57

ADF > all critical values, supporting non-stationarity.
Conclusion: Crude oil price time series appears non-stationary, suggesting the presence of trends or seasonality.
